# Logging in

Open the browser with the URL at which the front-end is being served, e.g. http://localhost.8080.

User login data is stored in the *Users* table in the database. 
You will need to create users before being able to log in.

For testing purposes, you may run the *init_unit_test_data.sql* to populate the database with test data. 
This will generate example users and assign label tasks to those users.
